    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will implement the Deep CNN-Based Blind Image Quality Predictor (DIQA) methodology proposed by Jongio Kim, Anh-Duc Nguyen, and Sanghoon Lee [1]. Also, I will go through the following TensorFlow 2.0 concepts:\n",
    "- Download and prepare a dataset using a *tf.data.Dataset builder*.\n",
    "- Define a TensorFlow input pipeline to pre-process the dataset records using the *tf.data* API.\n",
    "- Create the CNN model using the *tf.keras* functional API.\n",
    "- Define a custom training loop for the objective error map model.\n",
    "- Train the objective error map and subjective score model.\n",
    "- Use the trained subjective score model to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Some of the functions are implemented in [utils.py](https://github.com/ocampor/image-quality/blob/master/notebooks/utils.py) as they are out of the guide's scope.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DIQA?\n",
    "\n",
    "DIQA is an original proposal that focuses on solving some of the most concerning challenges of applying deep learning to image quality assessment (IQA). The advantages against other methodologies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is not limited to work exclusively with Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) images [1].\n",
    "- Prevents overfitting by splitting the training into two phases (1) feature learning and (2) mapping learned features to subjective scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of generating datasets for IQA is high since it requires expert supervision. Therefore, the fundamental IQA benchmarks are comprised of solely a few thousands of records. The latter complicates the creation of deep learning models because they require large amounts of training samples to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's consider the most frequently used datasets to train and evaluate IQA methods  [Live](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/subjective.htm),  [TID2008](http://www.ponomarenko.info/tid2008.htm), [TID2013](http://www.ponomarenko.info/tid2013.htm), [CSIQ](http://vision.eng.shizuoka.ac.jp/mod/page/view.php?id=23). An overall summary of each dataset is contained in the next table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dataset | References | Distortions | Severity | Total Samples |\n",
    "|---------|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|\n",
    "| LiveIQA | 29         | 5           | 5        | 1011          |\n",
    "| TID2008 | 25         | 17          | 5        | 1701          |\n",
    "| TID2013 | 25         | 24          | 5        | 3025          |\n",
    "| CSIQ    | 30         | 6           | 5        | 930           |\n",
    "\n",
    "The total amount of samples does not exceed 4,000 records for any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQA benchmarks only contain a limited amount of records that might not be enough to train a CNN. However, for this guide purpose, we are going to use the [Live](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/subjective.htm) dataset. It is comprised of 29 reference images, and 5 different distortions with 5 severity levels each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to download and prepare the dataset. I have created a couple of TensorFlow dataset builders\n",
    "for image quality assessment and published them in the [image-quality](https://github.com/ocampor/image-quality) package. The builders\n",
    "are an interface defined by [tensorflow-datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets). \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we learned how to utilize the tf.data module to create easy to read and memory-efficient data pipelines. Also, we implemented the Deep CNN-Based Blind Image Quality Predictor (DIQA) model using the functional Keras API. The model was trained with a custom training loop that uses the auto differentiation feature from TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find the hyperparameters that maximize the PLCC or SRCC accuracy metrics and evaluate the overall performance of the model against other methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to use a much larger dataset to train the objective error map model and see the resulting overall performance.\n",
